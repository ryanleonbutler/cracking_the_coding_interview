# Solutions and notes from problems in the Cracking the coding interview 6th edition book

## Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters (./questions/is_unique.py)
1.2 Check permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other (./questions/check_permutation.py)
1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with `%20` (./questions/urlify.py)
1.4 Palindrome permutation: Give a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome (./questions/palindrome.py)
1.5 One away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert, remove, replace. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away (./questions/palindrome.py)
1.6 String compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using counts of repeated characters (./questions/string_compression.py)
